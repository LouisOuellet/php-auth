## Can I use this?
Sure!

## License
This software is distributed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license. Please read [LICENSE](LICENSE) for information on the software availability and distribution.

## Requirements
* PHP >= 7.3.0
* MySQL or MariaDB

## Security
Please disclose any vulnerabilities found responsibly â€“ report security issues to the maintainers privately.

## Objects
* User
* Organization
* Group
* Role
* Permission

## Relationships
This library also includes support for relationships. Here are the ones already used in `phpAUTH`:

* User - Organization : User is a member of the Organization.
* User - Group : User is a member of the Group.
* User - Role : User is a member of the Role.
* Organization - Organization : Organization is a member of the Organization. Also known as a Subsidiary.
* Organization - Group : Organization can use the Group to manager it's members.
* Organization - Role : Organization can use the Role to manager it's members.
* Group - Role : Group is a member of the Role.

## User Statuses
* __1__: User is deleted (soft)
* __2__: User is banned
* __3__: User is locked out
* __4__: User has reach a rate limit (request or attempts)
* __5__: User is inactive
* __6__: User's e-mail is not verified
* __7__: User does not have any restrictions. OK.

## Understanding Roles and Groups
When using this library, permissions are assigned on roles. Roles can be assigned directly to a user or through a group of users. The highest permission level provided is used for validation. For example, if a user is member of role `Administrator` and `User`, both possess the permission `Dashboard`, `Administrator`'s level is set to `4` and `User`'s level is set to `1`, then the effective permission level is `4`.

### Permission Levels
* __0__: No access allowed
* __1__: Read access allowed
* __2__: Create access allowed
* __3__: Edit access allowed
* __4__: Delete access allowed

## Installation
Using Composer:
```sh
composer require laswitchtech/php-auth
```

## How do I use it?
IMPORTANT NOTICE, `phpAUTH` does not handle http headers. `phpAUTH` relies on your application to handle those. If you want your application to throw `403` headers for exemple, you will need to use the related method for validation and then throw your headers accordingly.

### Examples
There are many examples for you to check out in the [example](example) folder.

### Initiate
```php

// Initiate Session
session_start();

// These must be at the top of your script, not inside a function
use LaswitchTech\phpAUTH\phpAUTH;

// Load Composer's autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Initiate phpAUTH
$phpAUTH = new phpAUTH();
```

### Generate a GDPR/CCPA Compliance HTML Form
```php
// Generate a GDPR/CCPA Compliance HTML Form with Bootstrap 5
$phpAUTH->Compliance->form()
```

### Check if we can access through a specific hostname
```php
// Check if we can access through a specific hostname
$phpAUTH->Authorization->isAuthorized()
```

### Check if a User has a specific permission
```php
// Check if a User has a specific permission
$phpAUTH->Authorization->hasPermission($Name, $Level)
```

### Check if a User was authenticated
```php
// Check if a User was authenticated
$phpAUTH->Authentication->isConnected()
```

### Check if 2FA Request is ready
This method is useful to determine when to show the 2FA form.
```php
// Check if 2FA Request is ready
$phpAUTH->Authentication->is2FAReady()
```

### Check if email is verified
This method is useful to determine if the user's email address has been verified.
```php
// Check if email is verified
$phpAUTH->Authentication->isVerified()
```

### Logout user
This method logs out the user.
```php
// Logout user
$phpAUTH->Authentication->logout()
```

### Retrieve Authentication Error
This method retrieves authentication errors.
```php
// Retrieve Authentication Error
$phpAUTH->Authentication->error()
```

### Retrieve Authentication Status
This method retrieves the user's status.
```php
// Retrieve Authentication Status
$phpAUTH->Authentication->status()
```

### Using Managers
First managers allow you to manage objects such as Users, Organizations, Groups, Roles and Permissions
```php
// Create a Manager
$Manager = $phpAUTH->manage("users");

// Retrieve all Objects
$Objects = $Manager->read();

// Retrieve single Object
$Objects = $Manager->read($Identifier);
```

### Using Objects
```php
// Create
$Manager->create($Fields);

// Read
$Object->get($Field);

// Update
$Object->save($Fields);
// Or
$Manager->update($Identifier, $Fields);

// Delete
$Object->delete();
// Or
$Manager->delete($Identifier);

// Link
$Object->link($Table, $Id);

// Unlink
$Object->unlink($Table, $Id);
```

        ->config("encryption","ssl");

// Construct Hostnames
$Hostnames = ["localhost","::1","127.0.0.1"];
if(isset($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']) && !in_array($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'],$Hostnames)){
  $Hostnames[] = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
}
if(isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) && !in_array($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'],$Hostnames)){
  $Hostnames[] = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
}

$phpAUTH = new phpAUTH();

// Configure phpAUTH
$phpAUTH->config("hostnames",$Hostnames)
        ->config("basic",false) // Enable/Disable Basic Authentication

        ->config("session",true) // Enable/Disable Session Authentication
        ->config("2fa",true) // Enable/Disable 2-Factor Authentication
        ->config("maxAttempts",5) // Max amount of authentication attempts per windowAttempts
        ->config("maxRequests",1000) // Max amount of API request per windowRequests
        ->config("lockoutDuration",1800) // 30 mins
        ->config("windowAttempts",100) // 100 seconds
        ->config("windowRequests",60) // 60 seconds

// Install phpAUTH
$Installer = $phpAUTH->install();

// Create a User
$User = $Installer->create("user",["username" => "username@domain.com"]);
